# Header -- one hash mark

## Subhead -- two hash marks

* Bullet point 1 -- asterisks make a bullet point
* Bullet point 2

### What if you have three hash marks?
* One asterisk
** Two asterisks
** Two asterisks a second time -- not what I expected
* Back to just one asterisk


#### How about four hash marks for a subheader?
